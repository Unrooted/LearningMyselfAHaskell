In this repository I use various online courses to learn Haskell, I DO NOT own any of them, I just use them as my knowledge sources.

Courses: 

* https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/learning-path-haskell/9781788399425

* https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell

* http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters

The code in this repository does contain some code from mentioned sources, sometimes it's slightly modified, but it's based on mentioned courses.
